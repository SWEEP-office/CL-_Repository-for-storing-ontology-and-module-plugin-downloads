(The following text uses MS translation services, no need to mention machine translation😂)
You can also call this a website for downloading CL. Here, it provides plugins written by different people from various places. There's no need to introduce CL in detail, so let's explain how to use it properly!

What you do can package the entire repository into a zip file locally, which helps you with version control.

You must go to "https://colid.mysxl.cn/" to download a suitable version of COLID OS. Of course, we support all versions, but we still recommend downloading the latest version.

Before use, you can import the ontology using the 'Extensions' feature.

Wish you a pleasant experience
